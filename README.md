OctoEdit is a modern, open-source image editing application inspired by GIMP, built with a powerful multi-technology stack combining performance and usability.

## 🎯 Vision

To create a free, powerful, and user-friendly image editing software that combines the robustness of GIMP with modern interface design and extensibility.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Core Engine**: C++ (High-performance image processing)
- **Scripting & Automation**: Python (Extensibility and plugins)
- **Data Storage**: SQLite (Projects, preferences, metadata)
- **User Interface**: Electron (Cross-platform modern UI)

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

### Core Editing
- Layer management with masks and blend modes
- Advanced drawing tools (brushes, pencils, shapes)
- Professional retouching tools (clone, heal, perspective correction)
- Color management and adjustment tools
- Comprehensive filter and effects library

### Project Management
- SQLite-based project storage
- Complete edit history (unlimited undo/redo)
- Multi-format import/export (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PSD, etc.)
- Non-destructive editing workflow

### Extensibility
- Python scripting for automation
- Plugin architecture for custom tools and filters
- Script marketplace and sharing

### User Experience
- Modern Electron-based interface
- Tabbed project management
- Customizable workspace layouts
- Multiple theme support
- Performance-optimized rendering
